This repository contains the Master Thesis of Nikos Plastiras with title:

**"Optimization of tt+bb background simulation in the search for c-quark Yukawa coupling through the ttH(bb/cc) process in the CMS experiment at the LHC"**

For the purposes of this thesis, the following repositories were created:
- Instructions for the generation of the tt+bb events using POWHEG: [POWHEG-MC-Event-generation](https://github.com/nplastir/POWHEG-MC-Event-generation)
- Scripts for postprocessing the LHE files: [LHE-scripts](https://github.com/nplastir/LHE-scripts)

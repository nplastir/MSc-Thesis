\noindent The study of the associated production of top and bottom quark-antiquark pairs, t$\overline{\text{t}}+$b$\overline{\text{b}}$, in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC poses a significant challenge due to the nonnegligible mass of the b quark and the disparate energy scales characterizing interactions involving top and b quarks. %Consequently, determining appropriate energy scales for calculating t$\overline{\text{t}}+$b$\overline{\text{b}}$ matrix elements and seamlessly interfacing these matrix elements with parton shower (PS) and parton distribution function (PDF), calculations becomes a formidable task. 
Consequently, the determination of appropriate energy scales for the calculation of the t$\overline{\text{t}}+$b$\overline{\text{b}}$ matrix element and the seamless interface of the matrix element with parton distributions and parton showers becomes a non-trivial task. Uncertainties related to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales in matrix element calculations at NLO in QCD, can lead to uncertainties of up to 50\% in fiducial and differential cross section predictions of t$\overline{\text{t}}+$b$\overline{\text{b}}$ production. Improved knowledge of this process is therefore of prime interest in order to validate or discard scale choices made for state-of-the-art simulations. The primary objective of this thesis is to optimize the simulation of t$\overline{\text{t}}+$b$\overline{\text{b}}$ production, a pivotal background in numerous searches and measurements. Notably, t$\overline{\text{t}}+$b$\overline{\text{b}}$ is a prominent background in the associated production of a top quark pair with a Higgs boson (t$\overline{\text{t}}$H), where the Higgs boson decays to a pair of b or c quarks (H $\rightarrow$ b$\overline{\text{b}}/$c$\overline{\text{c}}$). An improved understanding of t$\overline{\text{t}}+$b$\overline{\text{b}}$ production will help reduce the uncertainties in the process t$\overline{\text{t}}$H(b$\overline{\text{b}}$/c$\overline{\text{c}}$), increasing the sensitivity of the search for c-quark Yukawa coupling, which is an important parameter of the Standard Model, being the Yukawa coupling of a second generation quark.
